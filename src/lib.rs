//! # `incrementalmerkletree`
//!
//! Incremental Merkle Trees are fixed-depth Merkle trees with two primary
//! capabilities: appending (assigning a value to the next unused leaf and
//! advancing the tree) and obtaining the root of the tree. Importantly the tree
//! structure attempts to store the least amount of information necessary to
//! continue to function; other information should be pruned eagerly to avoid
//! waste when the tree state is encoded.
//!
//! ## Marking
//!
//! Merkle trees are typically used to show that a value exists in the tree via
//! a witness. We need an API that allows us to identify the
//! current leaf as a value we wish to compute witnesss for even as
//! the tree continues to be appended to in the future; this is called
//! maintaining a witness. When we're later uninterested in such a leaf, we can
//! prune a witness and remove all unnecessary information from the structure as
//! a consequence.
//!
//! ## Checkpoints and Rollbacks
//!
//! The structure is not append-only in the strict sense. It is possible to
//! identify the current state of the tree as a "checkpoint" and to remove older
//! checkpoints that we're no longer interested in. It should be possible to
//! roll back to any previous checkpoint.
